# Boston_Housing
This repository contains project files for ‘Project 1 - Boston Housing’ as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. The project can be viewed by opening 'boston_housing.html' in a web browser, or can be run interactively by opening 'boston_housing.ipynb' in a Jupyter Notebook.

In this project, I show some basic statistics of data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. I then evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on this data. The model is used to make predictions of a home's monetary value. This kind of model would be useful to someone like a real estate agent on a daily basis, to help them make better business decisions.

Starter files provided by Udacity are in the 'Boston Housing Starter Files' folder.
