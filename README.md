# Boston_Housing
This repository contains project files for ‘Project 1 - Boston Housing’ as part of Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree. 

In this project, I show some basic statistics of data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. I then evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on this data. The model is used to make predictions of a home's monetary value. This kind of model would be useful to someone like a real estate agent on a daily basis, to help them make better business decisions.

The project can be viewed using the .html file in a web browser, or interactively opening the .ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook.

Starter files provided by Udacity are in the 'titanic_survival_exploration' folder. 

## Screenshots
Below are a couple screenshots showing the distribution of survivors based on age.
